# bluezebra-UI

This package is a modular UI framework to streamline building common features in iOS apps using SwiftUI. 

It encompasses many important features like a completely customisable Textfield (debounce and submit types), Navbar, Tab Bar, Text, ScrollView, and more. These components have served as much of the boilerplate code for building the bluezebra UI, as the components can be customised and readily dropped into any Swift codebase.
